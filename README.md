# Chia-Plot-Size-Combination-optimizer

The program will list all alternatives that are better than just plotting everything in K=32 (in descending order of drive utilization, with the last entry being the K=32 one).

How to use: Run program and type your HDD size in GiB as input. 

(Note 1: if plot sizes change again you'll have to tweak it at the top of the code, at time of writing it's 101.4GiB for k=32)

(Note 2: please do a final rough double check with a calculator your choice of plotting strategy after the results generate, I'm really amateur and could definitely make a mistake or have bugs/edge cases I missed!)
